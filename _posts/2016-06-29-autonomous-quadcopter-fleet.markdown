Yes this is quite ambitious idea to be able to create an autonomous
quadcopter fleet!

This is the kind of things that let me dream *Swarm Quadrotors by
[lexus-int](http://www.lexus-int.com/amazinginmotion/)*:

Today it's just an idea, a dream... There is no plan, a lot of details
are not define and hope that writing some blog post will help me to give
guide lines and focus on that project ;)

Current guides lines are very high level:

* This thing should fly which we are calling *quadcopter* in this post
* Expected to fly indoor
* Try to use common products available to general public and used by a
  lot of people
* Could be great to create a fleet
* quadcopter should be autonomous (no planning, no manual command)
* quadcopter would received desired state or target task (ie: bring the
  tv pad close to me, show me what's happen in the kitchen...)
* quadcopter should memory it's environment and share with others
* quadcopter should able to avoid contact and assume that is environment
  could change
* Openess! This project must be based on Open-source hardware and
  Open-source software!
